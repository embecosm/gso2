# GSOv2: The Superoptimization Toolkit

This respository holds the superoptimizer toolkit, a successor to the GNU Superoptimizer. Currently much of this is a work-in-progress and subject to change. A basic example of the superoptimizer can be found in `src/main.cpp`.

## Documentation

The documentation is also a work-in-progress, but there exists the start of a design document (LaTeX), which can be built with the `make doc` command.

## Requirements

Python:

- pyyaml
- docopt

C++:

- A C++11 compiler
- boost algorithm
- boost unit test (for the tests)
